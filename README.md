Hello! This GitHub repository was built for an assignment as part of my doctoral training.

A short presentation of myself:
I am a French biologist who did a bachelor in cellular and molecular physiology in Nantes (France) before taking a gap year of working and traveling all around New Zealand. I specialized in pathophysiology during my master in Toulouse and as my interest for multidisciplinary research was growing, I decided to join Jonathan Turnerâ€™s group in LIH for my PhD. Apart from my interest in science, I enjoy traveling across Europe by train and connecting with new people.
